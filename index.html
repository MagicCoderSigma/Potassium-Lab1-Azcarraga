			<h1> CODM: </h1>
			<p> Call of Duty follows the exploits of three soldiers fighting for three different nations. The American campaign features Private Martin, Baker Company's sniper, demolitions expert, intel collector, and pathfinder. Players can choose to play ranked or non-ranked matches in multiplayer mode. It has two types of in-game currencies: "Credits", which are earned through playing the game, and "COD Points", which are bought with real-world money.</p>
